# 为workflow添加描述和注释 (2025-08-10 03:31Z)

_**User**_

请参考@https://nunchaku.tech/docs/ComfyUI-nunchaku/workflows/toc.html 对所有的workflow添加对应的描述，以及在必要的页面或者位置添加注释，注释请尽量小字体且淡化显示。注释的目的是让不懂comfyui或者不懂flux的人来开箱即可用

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring app workflows**

I’m considering where the app displays workflows, like maybe in a gallery. It’s also important to think about where to insert annotations that could be small and faded text. This could happen in different parts: either in the front-end using React, Next, or Vue, or even within server templates. I should start by listing the repo root to keep track of where these elements might be implemented.</details></think>

---

我先快速扫描项目，找出现有的 workflow 文件及前端展示它们的位置，方便批量为每个 workflow 增加描述，并在界面上添加淡化的小注释。随后我会并行搜索与“workflow/flux/comfyui/描述或提示文案”相关的代码位置。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Collaborating on workflow descriptions**

I need to add descriptions for all workflows based on the Nunchaku documentation. The plan is to modify the code to include UI annotations, helping non-experts use it more easily. I’ll start by scanning the repository for where workflows are defined and how the UI presents them, likely in JSON files, `app.py`, and templates. I’ll create a mapping of workflow names to descriptions from the Nunchaku doc and update the pages accordingly. Multitasking seems like a good idea here!
**Searching for workflow occurrences**

I need to dig into the codebase and search for occurrences of the "workflow" string using grep. This will help me identify where workflows are present. Additionally, I want to look into how these workflows are loaded, so I'll perform a codebase search for that as well. I think running these searches will give me a clearer picture of how everything fits together and what needs updating! Let's get started!</details></think>

---

我将并行查看 `workflow` 目录下的文件、`templates` 模板以及代码中关于 workflow 的使用位置，确定如何批量为每个 workflow 添加描述并在界面插入淡化小注释。随后基于文档页为各 workflow 增补说明并实现前端展示。

我将读取 `templates/index.html`、`templates/gallery.html`、`static/js/app.js` 和 `static/css` 以查找前端展示工作流的位置，并打开 `app.py` 以实现基于文件名的详细描述映射，然后并行读取这些文件。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating workflow descriptions**

I need to implement descriptions for all workflows based on the referenced documentation. The workflow directory has filenames matching that list, but the backend function `get_workflow_description` doesn’t cover all of them. The user asked for descriptive additions and small faded hints for better usability, especially for those unfamiliar with ComfyUI or Flux. I'll list all workflows to update the backend mapping and ensure clarity for novice users on necessary pages and locations.
**Clarifying workflow details**

The documentation lists an "ip-adapter" workflow, but I can’t find that file in the workflow directory, so I’ll concentrate on the existing workflows instead. My goal is to create user-friendly descriptions according to the document’s categories. I’ll cite the doc link in my response. The backend provides node counts, and it seems the front end uses "workflow-cards" to present these descriptions. I will check the app.js file to understand how the cards are constructed by searching for relevant terms like 'workflow-cards' and 'description'.</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing workflow descriptions**

I need to focus on adding descriptions for each workflow based on the Nunchaku documentation. The repository includes workflows like FLUX Text-to-Image and ControlNets, but there seems to be an absence of the IP-Adapter file. I’ll utilize `get_workflow_description` to provide human-friendly details about the existing workflows and fill in any missing mappings. Additionally, I should create small, faded annotations in the UI to assist newcomers who may not be familiar with ComfyUI or Flux.
**Adding helpful hints**

I'm planning to enhance the selection page by adding small hints around specific areas like "提示词设置" and "基础生成参数." Each hint will provide helpful guidance to users. For instance, I could place a suggestion below "选择工作流" that recommends starting with FLUX.1 Schnell or FLUX.1 Dev. In the intro card area, a note can indicate that required models will auto-load. Additionally, hints about typical sizes, values, and random explanations will be beneficial. I'll make sure these hints are subtle yet informative!
**Crafting workflow descriptions**

There's a message in the backend regarding optional elements, but I need to focus on crafting descriptions for each workflow based on the docs. The documentation page is just a TOC, but I'll provide standard explanations like "从文字生成图像" for FLUX Text-to-Image. I can detail other workflows too, such as Kontext, ControlNets, and PuLID. I need to note that we may also include "intro feature tags" in the front-end, possibly utilizing the `renderWorkflows` function and `getFeatureTags`.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing workflow descriptions**

I need to add descriptions for all workflows based on the Nunchaku docs workflow page. The user requested that these descriptions also include annotations, ideally in small, faded font, to help those unfamiliar with comfyui or flux. Our code has some mapping in app.py, but it's likely incomplete. We should expand descriptions for all current workflow files and ensure they include proper UI hints in the right places, such as near prompts and image inputs.
**Adding helpful hints**

I want to add hints in the intro card with "注释" for newbies, which could also appear on the selection page. For each workflow card, I can include a small, muted hint about what users should prepare. Currently, `renderWorkflows` uses `p.workflow-description`, but I’ll extend it to include a "helper-hint" or "note" style. Since there’s no specific CSS class for this, I could reuse `.form-hint` and create a new `.helper-note`. Also, adding hints in the parameter config page could help novices understand terms like "prompt," "seed," and "steps."
**Simplifying hint integration**

I’m considering a straightforward approach to add small hint paragraphs in `templates/index.html`. For example, under the title "选择工作流开始您的AI图像生成之旅," I could include some small text hints. Additionally, hints under sections like Prompt and Basic Parameters would meet the user's request for annotations. They prefer hints in a small, faded font, so `.form-hint` is appropriate. I also need to update the JSON mapping in app.py to return descriptions sourced from the docs for each workflow filename, ensuring the code remains intact.
**Adding helpful hints and descriptions**

I want to use the hint class to add new hints in several places. For instance, on the selection page, near the quick select label, I'll add the hint "选择上方的工作流，点击开始配置." I also plan to include a hint under the intro card to summarize usage with "写一句." Moreover, hints will be necessary under the positive and negative prompts on the parameter config page. For workflow cards, I might add an overlay hint, though existing descriptions may suffice. The user has requested accurate Chinese descriptions for all workflows, so I'll craft specific summaries based on typical functions.
**Refining workflow descriptions**

I realize we need to be careful and not guess too much. The docs specify FLUX ControlNets with files like "nunchaku-flux.1-dev-controlnet-union-pro2.json" and "nunchaku-flux.1-dev-controlnet-upscaler.json." I can offer generic descriptions, such as indicating that ControlNets are for conditional generation, with the union pro2 using ControlNet Union Pro 2. 

For other workflows, I can provide descriptions for FLUX PuLID as identity preservation and FLUX Redux for image-to-image transformation, among others. I also need to ensure that the app.py mapping captures all present patterns and add minor UI hints where necessary. To implement these changes, I'll refine the `get_workflow_description` function and review the lines indicated for proper editing.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing user request**

I need to implement the user's request to reference a given URL document for workflows and add descriptions and annotations where necessary. Annotations should be in a small, faded font to assist non-ComfyUI/Flux users. We have a Flask app with templates and a backend that generates workflow descriptions based on filename heuristics. I'll enrich these descriptions to align with the document for all listed workflows. It seems that there are some discrepancies regarding the IP-Adapter in the workflow directory, which I need to clarify.
**Mapping descriptions and annotations**

I didn't find the IP-Adapter file during my earlier list check, so I can't map its description. However, I'll ensure to map each filename to a detailed description, including features. The front-end uses this description string and extracts feature tags from the filename. There's also a `getShortDescription` limited to 30 characters, but the card displays the full description. I'll add small faded annotations to help non-experts, like on the selection page and in parameter configurations, making use of existing CSS class for hints. I'll modify `templates/index.html` to include these notes appropriately.
**Enhancing hints and descriptions**

The front-end utilizes JavaScript for dynamic content, but it's fine to add static hints in HTML. I can also display hints for intro features when a workflow is selected. The user has requested small, faded annotations on necessary pages. I’ll use spans with the class `.form-hint`. Additionally, I need to ensure that every workflow has its description; I can expand the `get_workflow_description` to cover all 15 workflows, mapping for specific names like upscaler, union pro2, and others. This should work well and fill in any gaps effectively.
**Reviewing mappings and descriptions**

I’ve confirmed the mapping for the upscaler is present. For canny-lora, we have mappings for both 'canny' and 'lora', and I need to double-check if the code correctly separates them. The code does have branches for each filename. It’s great that I can add documentation-based descriptions for more precision. Although the current docs only have the table of contents, I can create concise Chinese descriptions for each workflow. I will also ensure the small hints in the UI using the `.form-hint` class are implemented correctly.
**Implementing hints and mapping updates**

I’ll add hint text near important fields and possibly tooltips or help icons near workflow cards while keeping everything minimal. The main code updates involve extending `get_workflow_description` in `app.py` to return mapping with richer content for specific filenames. I’ll ensure hints are integrated throughout, especially near the workflow selection and parameters in `templates/index.html`. Additionally, I’ll include hints in the gallery section and ensure they meet design standards. It sounds like we need to approach this carefully to avoid breaking anything significant in the existing structure.
**Updating hints and structure**

For the parameter configuration, I’ll add hints in key areas like the positive and negative prompt textareas right after their respective markup lines. In the compact image input section, I’ll insert a hint above or below the grid within the `imageInputsCompactSection`. I also plan to add hints in the traditional image input section, the basic parameters collapsible content, and the controlnet and model loader sections. Finally, I’ll include a small hint on the gallery page after existing text. I’ll proceed to patch everything while ensuring no syntax errors occur.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Optimizing model info extraction**

I want to guarantee that model information in the metadata remains consistent, no matter the front-end overrides or node IDs. I'm considering implementing a helper function to extract model loader info from either 'api_workflow' or 'ui_workflow' nodes. Within _process_task_outputs, I see that we can access task_info, which includes the 'prompt' variable. I need to explore how task_info outputs are managed and ensure we extract model data effectively during metadata saving.
**Refining metadata extraction**

I’m considering adding to the ‘parameters’ before saving metadata. Within _process_task_outputs, I can access 'task_info', which houses the 'prompt' from ComfyUI history. The code uses _extract_actual_seed, accessing task_info.get('prompt', []) and nodes_config, which seems to be a tuple of history. This is a little odd, but I can parse nodes_config and extract a 'model_loaders' dictionary. I think I'll implement a function to extract model loaders based on specific class types and their relevant values.
**Implementing model loader extraction**

In the nodes_config map, the input names follow the WIDGET_INDEX_MAP mapping. For instance, 'NunchakuFluxDiTLoader' matches inputs like 'model_path', 'cache_threshold', and others. I’m planning to implement _extract_model_loaders to return sections: one keyed by 'model_path_<nodeId>' and another as a 'summary' for 'main_model', 'vae', and 'lora'. The front-end currently expects keys like 'model_loaders.model_path_45'. I might add generic keys in the metadata parameters to avoid rewriting the front-end while keeping track of node IDs, even if they differ in workflows.
**Improving model loading in the front-end**

I need to change the front-end to avoid relying on fixed node IDs. Although it already uses groupModelLoaders() for the metadata modal, the gallery card only picks a 'mainModel' from model_path_45 or model_type_44. I should enhance the gallery rendering by finding the first key in model_loaders that matches model_path_*, ckpt_name_*, or model_type*. If 'summary.main_model' exists in metadata.parameters, I’ll use that instead. The back-end will include 'parameters.model_loaders' filled from nodes_config and add 'parameters.model_summary.main_model' and 'parameters.model_summary.vae'. On the front-end, I'll update the gallery.js code to compute the mainModel by iterating through the keys in model_loaders. I want to prefer keys starting with 'model_path_', then 'ckpt_name_', 'model_type_', and so on, displaying the first non-empty value, fallbacking to 'N/A' if necessary.
**Updating model info in gallery**

I need to edit `static/js/app.js`, focusing on the gallery code that builds modelInfo. I found the relevant code inline within `templates/gallery.html`, specifically between lines 431-449. My plan is to create a function, getPrimaryModelName(modelLoaders), that will scan keys more reliably. Also, in _process_task_outputs, I should enrich the metadata before saving. I'll extract model loaders from prompt_data if they're not already in parameters. 

I'll implement helper methods in WorkflowRunner, extracting model loaders similar to how _extract_actual_seed functions. I’ll traverse the nodes_config dictionary and build a summary before calling the extraction. Finally, I need to update the gallery script for robust model fallback detection. Let's make those changes!</details></think>

我已定位并修复“Kontext 生成的图片在画廊 Model 为空”的问题，确保所有工作流都能记录与显示模型信息。

- 修复点（后端 `app.py`）
  - 在保存图片元数据时，新增实际执行模型的提取逻辑：从 ComfyUI 返回的 prompt 中解析模型加载器节点，收集主模型、VAE、LoRA，写入元数据：
    - `model_loaders`（by_node 展开，键名形如 `model_path_45`）
    - `model_summary`（汇总：`main_model`、`vae`、`loras`）
  - 位置：`_process_task_outputs` 内保存 `metadata` 前调用 `_extract_model_loaders`；新增 `_extract_model_loaders` 方法，兼容 `NunchakuFluxDiTLoader`、`CheckpointLoaderSimple`、`VAELoader`、`NunchakuFluxLoraLoader`/`LoraLoader` 等节点。

- 展示点（前端 `templates/gallery.html`）
  - 优先使用 `metadata.model_summary` 展示主模型/vae/loras；其次回退到 `metadata.model_loaders`；再次回退到旧结构 `metadata.parameters.model_loaders`。
  - 这样 Kontext、Dev、Schnell、ControlNet、Fill、Depth、Canny 等工作流都能正确显示 Model 信息。

- 影响范围
  - 新生成的图片会在元数据中包含模型摘要；旧图若无该字段，仍尝试从旧位置读取，尽量显示主模型。

请重新用 `nunchaku-flux.1-kontext-dev` 生成一张图查看画廊，Model 一栏应显示。例如：
- Model: flux.1-dev-fp8.safetensors | VAE: flux_vae.safetensors | LoRA: my_style_lora

- 关键改动
  - `app.py`: 新增 `_extract_model_loaders` 并在保存元数据时注入 `model_loaders` 与 `model_summary`。
  - `templates/gallery.html`: 模型显示逻辑改为优先读 `model_summary`，并提供两级回退，修复为空问题。

我已修复“参数按钮后的生成参数/模型加载器为空”的问题，按你截图中的展示思路补齐后端记录与前端渲染，确保所有工作流（含 Kontext/Redux 等）都能显示模型与参数。

- 后端修复（`app.py`）
  - 在保存图片元数据时，新增两类提取：
    - 模型信息：解析实际执行的 prompt，提取主模型、VAE、LoRA，并写入
      - `model_summary`: { main_model, vae, loras }
      - `model_loaders`: by_node 展开，键如 `model_path_45`、`vae_name_10`
    - 生成参数：从执行的 prompt 中补齐 steps/cfg/sampler/scheduler/denoise/width/height 等，写回到 `metadata.parameters`，仅在前端未显式设置时填充
  - 这样即使某些工作流未通过参数面板传值，依然能在详情中显示“实际使用”的参数与模型
- 前端渲染（`templates/gallery.html`）
  - 图片卡片 Model 概要：
    - 优先 `metadata.model_summary`，回退 `metadata.model_loaders`，再回退 `metadata.parameters.model_loaders`
  - 参数弹窗（你点“参数”看到的地方）：
    - “生成参数”保留原有显示，并包含自动补齐的 steps/cfg/seed/width/height 等
    - 新增“模型加载器（摘要）”模块，显示 主模型/VAE/LoRA
    - 新增“模型加载器（详细）”模块，按节点分组展开显示（与你截图的“VAE节点(10)/主模型节点(45)”一致）

请用 `nunchaku-flux.1-kontext-dev` 或 `nunchaku-flux.1-redux-dev` 再生成一张图，然后：
- 画廊卡片应显示 Model: 主模型 | VAE | LoRA（若有）
- 点击“参数”：
  - “生成参数”里能看到 steps/cfg/sampler 等
  - “模型加载器（摘要/详细）”能看到你截图类似的节点分组与字段

如果仍有某个工作流缺字段，我再对该 workflow 的节点类型做专项兼容。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing model path details**

It looks like I found the main model path under 'model_path' at Node id 45. The screenshot shows a collapsed area with perhaps hidden values. The black area on top may just be due to how the text appears against a dark background. I think I should acknowledge the result and ask for confirmation about whether the "模型加载器（摘要）" is displaying correctly. Since the user didn’t request a change, I’ll keep my response minimal but suggest testing other workflows.
**Providing minimal content update**

I’ll communicate that the current result shows all parameters filled. If anything is blank, I'll instruct to scroll down. I need to outline next steps to verify three items: confirm model summary is present, ensure node details are visible, and check that the image card shows the model. If anything is missing, enabling debug logging may help. My final response will briefly state these points in a concise note with bullet steps for clarity.</details></think>

看到了，你这次的“生成参数”已正常展示，且弹窗底部已出现“模型加载器（摘要）/（详细）”区块。请快速确认三点：
- 画廊卡片中的 Model 概要是否已显示主模型/vae/LoRA
- 弹窗“模型加载器（摘要）”是否列出 main_model / vae / loras
- 弹窗“模型加载器（详细）”是否按节点分组（如 VAE 节点10、主模型节点45）

若仍有任一处为空：
- 请把该图片同名的元数据文件放到我这看一下（`outputs/<图片名>.json`）
- 或把最新的 `app.log` 里包含 “提取模型信息失败/提取生成参数失败” 的片段贴来，我就按报错行继续兼容更多节点类型（Kontext/Redux 已涵盖 `NunchakuFluxDiTLoader`、`CheckpointLoaderSimple`、`VAELoader`、`NunchakuFluxLoraLoader`/`LoraLoader`、`ModelSamplingFlux`）。

- 本次变更要点
  - 元数据新增 `model_summary` 与 `model_loaders`（by_node），并自动补齐 steps/cfg/sampler/width/height
  - 参数弹窗新增“模型加载器（摘要/详细）”渲染，且卡片 Model 概要走同一来源

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Debugging output reading**

I need to debug the reading of the outputs JSON metadata to ensure all necessary fields are present for the front-end. The user mentioned the metadata file located at outputs/<name>.json has 146 lines. I’ll read it using functions.read_file and analyze why fields like model_summary and model_loaders are missing. It could be due to how we're extracting data from task_info['prompt']. I should check where task_info originates in _process_task_outputs and confirm its structure from _check_task_completion.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Debugging JSON outputs**

I’m trying to figure out why the model loader summary and by_node are empty in the JSON. The user mentioned they opened the JSON file, so I’ll read it to check what was stored. I should compare our code where we write metadata during processing. The user’s screenshot might show the summary section, but it could be collapsed. I need to ensure we read the correct property names and confirm how we handle the sections in the code. The issue still needs resolution since everything seems empty.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Troubleshooting blank sections**

The user attached a screenshot showing blank sections labeled "模型加载器（摘要）." It looks like they’re not seeing the content we're expecting from the JSON, including model_summary and model_loaders. Maybe it's because our code in gallery.html only displays the data after the "生成参数" block, but it's possible there's a CSS issue causing the collapse. I wonder if the front-end is using a cached copy of gallery.html? Also, the "参数按钮" on the card should trigger the metadata display, so this should show properly.
**Investigating metadata issues**

I'm considering if the JSON loaded by the API endpoint could be returning older metadata that lacks model fields if the server wasn’t restarted. The user did show that the API returns the correct JSON fields, so the model summary should be included. They see sections for "模型加载器（摘要）" and "（详细）" but with blank content. I wonder if the HTML blocks are there but the content is hidden due to CSS? I also need to think about whether 'metadataContent' is being overwritten later, but it seems like it should work as coded.
**Checking code for model loaders**

I want to verify if our code prints the '生成参数' object and handles 'model_loaders' correctly. There's an existing loop that processes parameters, including 'model_loaders,' so that looks good. However, it treats 'model_loaders' as an object and calls groupModelLoaders, which expects specific keys like 'vae_name_10' and 'text_encoder.' In the JSON, I see different keys, like 'vae_name_39' and others. The mapping from our groupModelLoaders uses static node IDs, which means it won't group these nodes correctly, but they'll still be included, right?
**Analyzing groupModelLoaders function**

The function groupModelLoaders iterates through keys to extract node IDs using a regex pattern. It relies on the 'nodeMappings' for derivation of group keys, but nodes with IDs like 39 and 189 lack defined mappings. As a result, groups for 'vae,' 'text_encoder,' and 'main_model' remain empty, leading to nothing being included in the returned HTML. Thus, we see "点击查看详细模型配置," but there’s nothing inside. Although metadata.model_summary exists and includes values, the user says sections are blank. I wonder if the values are showing as 'N/A' instead? It seems like the issue stems from incorrect node ID mappings, suggesting a need for generic grouping based on key base names.
**Updating groupModelLoaders function**

I’m planning to classify keys based on their names to categorize them: 'model_path' for the main_model, 'vae_name' for vaes, 'lora_name' for loras, and 'clip_name*' for text encoders. This way, we'll show information regardless of node IDs. I want to update the JS function groupModelLoaders to derive these groups and also render a generic listing for unknown keys. 

Let’s modify the earlier quick model card snippet using 'image.metadata.model_summary.' I'll make sure that viewMetadata adds the summary and details. We should classify things generically in gallery.html, such as grouping keys into arrays for each category and adding nodes like 'data_type_189' under an 'other' category or possibly a sampler section. Time to implement these changes!</details></think>

我看到了你打开的元数据文件，里面已经包含：
- model_summary.main_model: svdq-int4_r32-flux.1-kontext-dev.safetensors
- model_summary.vae: ae.safetensors
- parameters 和顶层的 model_loaders 键值对也都存在

问题在于前端分组函数之前按固定节点号(10/44/45/46/47)匹配，Kontext 的实际节点号为 39/38/189…，导致“模型加载器（摘要/详细）”渲染为空。我已更新分组逻辑为基于键名前缀的通用识别，不再依赖固定节点号，并且保证摘要优先显示：

- 变更
  - 模型摘要优先显示 `metadata.model_summary`（main_model/vae/loras），再显示 by_node 详细分组
  - 详细分组改为前缀分组：
    - vae_name_* → VAE
    - model_path_* / ckpt_name_* → 主模型
    - clip_name* / text_encoder* → 文本编码器
    - lora_name_* → LoRA
    - 其他键 → 其他
  - 画廊卡片的 Model 概要也走相同优先级回退逻辑

请刷新后再点任意图片“参数”：
- “模型加载器（摘要）”应显示主模型/vae/loras
- “模型加载器（详细）”应显示分组内容（不再要求节点10/45等固定编号）

如仍有异常，请截一张“模型加载器（详细）”展开后的画面；或把该图的 JSON 中 `model_loaders`（by_node）那一段发我，我再补充更多前缀/别名映射。
